As part of the course “NFYK13011U Applied Statistics: From Data to Results” all students needed to analyze data following two experiments as part of a project. The project was an attempt at precision measurement of the Earth’s gravitation g locally, using only “simple” methods. The two separate experiments were:
• Simple pendulum.
• Ball rolling down an incline.
The goal was to determine g in two ways and propagate the uncertainties on these measurements. The project counted 20% of our final grade,
